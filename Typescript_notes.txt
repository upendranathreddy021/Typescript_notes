==============> Typescript NOtes   <================

typescript is strict  typed language so we need to specify the data type of our variables.

different data types in typescript are :
  Primitive Data types: 
    1. Number: it represents any integer  ex: 4,3 , let c:Number=5
    2. String: it represents a sequence of any characters  ex: "hello","string", let b:string="hello"
    3. Boolean : true or false ex: let a:boolean=true;
    4. undefined:used when variable not assigned
    5. null: used when there is no value  ex: let obj;
    6. void: that doesn't return nothing
    
special data types:
    1.enums
    2.any
    3.unknown
    4.undefined
    5.null
    6.never
    
Non primitive datatypes:
    1.Arrays
    2.Tuple
    3.Object types


Assertions: changing variable from one datatype to another datatype
Type assertions are meant only for type checking at compile time and don't affect runtime behavior

type casting is based on some type of runtime support

where as type Assertions is based on compiler time support

scopes : 
  - local scope (let)  ==> with in object or method or upto end of block where declared
  - global scope(var)  ==> it can access anywhere with in the file
  - class scope    ==> it is in class outside methods and object
  static variable ==> it can be accessed by using the class name

interface  ==> specifying the datatypes to the objects
